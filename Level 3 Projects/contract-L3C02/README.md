## LEVEL 4

## Contract 02 Project - Meta Transaction (transactions where gas is paid by different accounts)

## Problem Statement

**Calls to the contract using meta transaction then there will be 0 gas fees for all such transaction. This is important because most the dapp have their own ERC20 tokens but the gas fees has to be paid in native currency like ETH value. Hence if we somehow make the ETH value gas = 0, then all transactions for the dapp can be paid using the ERC20 tokens only. But yeah somebody needs to pay for the gas, just the user will not pay.  **

For this project, we need the frontend react application also as there are few things like signing that can only be done offchain.
