## Informational Hint

### Modulo operator

Any integer that can be divided exactly (i.e. remainder = 0) by 2 is an even number.

- Modulo: The modulo operation `a % n` yields the remainder `r` after the division of the operand `a` by the operand `n`.

### Boolean Value Type

`bool`: The possible values are constants true and false.

### Logical Operators:

- ! (logical negation)
- && (logical conjunction, “and”)
- || (logical disjunction, “or”)
- == (equality)
- != (inequality)

The operators `||` and `&&` apply the common short-circuiting rules. This means that in the expression `f(x) || g(y)`, if `f(x)` evaluates to true, `g(y)` will not be evaluated even if it may have side-effects.
