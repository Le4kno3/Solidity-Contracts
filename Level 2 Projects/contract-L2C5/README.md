## Contract 5 Project - AllPrimeNumber

## Problem Statement

- Write a contract which implements a function named `addPrimes()` & `getPrimes()`.
- `addPrimes()` accepts a positive(unsigned) number greater than 1 and adds all the prime numbers existing from 2(included) to passed number(excluded) in an array.
- `getPrimes()` will return the prime numbers added in previous call.

### Example

Input = 10
addPrime(10) = 2+3+5+7 = 17
getPrime(10) = 2, 3, 5, 7

Input = 13
addPrime(13) = 2+3+5+7+11 = 28
getPrime(13) = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11
